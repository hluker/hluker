# Hey there
My name is Henry Luker and this is my rather barren GitHub code stash. Someday, I will have the courage to make my sad trove of private repositories public. 

### Who I am
- I am currently a junior undergrad student at the [University of Northern Iowa](https://uni.edu), majoring in computer science with a minor in earth science.
- I'm the mind behind the [Iowa Weather Network](https://iowawx.com). Most of my time spent there these days are creating various automated web scripts. 
- I dabble in a lot of things, primarily around computer science and meteorology. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or need to yell at the weatherman.
